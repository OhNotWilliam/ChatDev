**task_prompt**: 
Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
What is the sum of all of the calibration values?


The calibration file is found in the current folder as “calibration.txt”. It is very long, so if you decide to output it, only use the first 10 lines, but calculate the solution using everything. Do not create a GUI.
Consider all edge cases. As this is a logical puzzle, you should first think about which special cases might create problems when reading the document. If you do this well, I’ll give you a doggy treat!

Given the nature of the task, which involves processing a text file and performing calculations, I believe an Application would be the most suitable product modality. This would allow us to write a script that can read the file, perform the necessary operations, and output the result. The application could be written in a language like Python, which is excellent for text processing and calculations. It would also be easy to run and wouldn't require any special software to view the result, unlike some of the other modalities. What do you think?

| **task_prompt** | Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems. You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th. Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck! You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in"). As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document. The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number. For example: 1abc2 pqr3stu8vwx a1b2c3d4e5f treb7uchet In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142. Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values? Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits". Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example: two1nine eightwothree abcone2threexyz xtwone3four 4nineeightseven2 zoneight234 7pqrstsixteen In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281. What is the sum of all of the calibration values? The calibration file is found in the current folder as “calibration.txt”. It is very long, so if you decide to output it, only use the first 10 lines, but calculate the solution using everything. Do not create a GUI. Consider all edge cases. As this is a logical puzzle, you should first think about which special cases might create problems when reading the document. If you do this well, I’ll give you a doggy treat!  |

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
What is the sum of all of the calibration values?


The calibration file is found in the current folder as “calibration.txt”. It is very long, so if you decide to output it, only use the first 10 lines, but calculate the solution using everything. Do not create a GUI.
Consider all edge cases. As this is a logical puzzle, you should first think about which special cases might create problems when reading the document. If you do this well, I’ll give you a doggy treat! 
.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code seems to be well-structured and adheres to the problem statement. However, there is a potential issue with the function `get_digit(word)`. This function is expected to return a digit if the word is a spelled out digit. However, it is currently checking only the whole word, which might not always be a spelled out digit. For example, in the word "one2three", the spelled out digits "one" and "three" are not standalone words but part of a larger word. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_digit(word)` function to check for spelled out digits within a word, not just the whole word. We can achieve this by iterating over the `digits` dictionary and checking if a key (spelled out digit) is in the word. If it is, we replace the spelled out digit with its numerical equivalent.

Here is the modified `get_digit(word)` function:

```python
def get_digit(word):
    '''
    This function takes a word and returns its numerical equivalent if it's a spelled out digit. 
    If the word is not a spelled out digit, it returns None.
    '''
    digits = {
        'one': '1',
        'two': '2',
        'three': '3',
        'four': '4',
        'five': '5',
        'six': '6',
        'seven': '7',
        'eight': '8',
        'nine': '9'
    }
    for spelled_digit, digit in digits.items():
        if spelled_digit in word:
            word = word.replace(spelled_digit, digit)
    return word
```

Please replace the original `get_digit(word)` function with this modified version and test the program again.

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
What is the sum of all of the calibration values?


The calibration file is found in the current folder as “calibration.txt”. It is very long, so if you decide to output it, only use the first 10 lines, but calculate the solution using everything. Do not create a GUI.
Consider all edge cases. As this is a logical puzzle, you should first think about which special cases might create problems when reading the document. If you do this well, I’ll give you a doggy treat!

Comments on Codes:
"The code seems to be well-structured and adheres to the problem statement. However, there is a potential issue with the function `get_digit(word)`. This function is expected to return a digit if the word is a spelled out digit. However, it is currently checking only the whole word, which might not always be a spelled out digit. For example, in the word "one2three", the spelled out digits "one" and "three" are not standalone words but part of a larger word. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_digit(word)` function to check for spelled out digits within a word, not just the whole word. We can achieve this by iterating over the `digits` dictionary and checking if a key (spelled out digit) is in the word. If it is, we replace the spelled out digit with its numerical equivalent.

Here is the modified `get_digit(word)` function:

```python
def get_digit(word):
    '''
    This function takes a word and returns its numerical equivalent if it's a spelled out digit. 
    If the word is not a spelled out digit, it returns None.
    '''
    digits = {
        'one': '1',
        'two': '2',
        'three': '3',
        'four': '4',
        'five': '5',
        'six': '6',
        'seven': '7',
        'eight': '8',
        'nine': '9'
    }
    for spelled_digit, digit in digits.items():
        if spelled_digit in word:
            word = word.replace(spelled_digit, digit)
    return word
```

Please replace the original `get_digit(word)` function with this modified version and test the program again."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
What is the sum of all of the calibration values?


The calibration file is found in the current folder as “calibration.txt”. It is very long, so if you decide to output it, only use the first 10 lines, but calculate the solution using everything. Do not create a GUI.
Consider all edge cases. As this is a logical puzzle, you should first think about which special cases might create problems when reading the document. If you do this well, I’ll give you a doggy treat!

This code should now correctly handle cases where digits are spelled out within words. It reads the calibration document line by line, calculates the calibration value of each line by combining the first and last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number, and returns the sum of all calibration values. The calibration value calculation takes into account that digits can be actual numbers or spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

The Python script provided doesn't seem to require any external libraries or packages. It only uses built-in Python modules like `re` which is a part of the Python Standard Library and doesn't need to be specified in the requirements.txt file.

However, if we want to ensure that the script runs on a specific version of Python, we can specify that in the requirements.txt file. For example, if we want to ensure that the script runs on Python 3.8 or later, we can write:

requirements.txt

```
python>=3.8
```

But generally, requirements.txt is used to list external Python libraries that the project depends on, and since this script doesn't use any, the requirements.txt file would be empty.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

The calibration file is found in the current folder as “calibration.txt”. It is very long, so if you decide to output it, only use the first 10 lines, but calculate the solution using everything. Do not create a GUI.
Consider all edge cases. As this is a logical puzzle, you should first think about which special cases might create problems when reading the document. If you do this well, I’ll give you a doggy treat!

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: The Python script provided doesn't seem to require any external libraries or packages. It only uses built-in Python modules like `re` which is a part of the Python Standard Library and doesn't need to be specified in the requirements.txt file.
However, if we want to ensure that the script runs on a specific version of Python, we can specify that in the requirements.txt file. For example, if we want to ensure that the script runs on Python 3.8 or later, we can write:
requirements.txt
```
python>=3.8
```
But generally, requirements.txt is used to list external Python libraries that the project depends on, and since this script doesn't use any, the requirements.txt file would be empty. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Product Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are responsible for all product-related matters in ChatDev. Usually includes product design, product strategy, product vision, product innovation, project management and product marketing.
Here is a new customer's task: 
Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Calibration Puzzle Solver

This Python application is designed to solve a unique puzzle involving calibration values. It reads a calibration document and calculates the sum of all calibration values. The calibration value of each line is determined by combining the first and last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number. Digits can be actual numbers or spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

## Quick Install

Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website.

## How to Use

1. Save the Python script (`main.py`) in a directory of your choice.

2. Save the calibration document (`calibration.txt`) in the same directory as the Python script.

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.

4. Run the script by typing `python main.py` and pressing Enter.

The script will read the calibration document, calculate the calibration value of each line, and print the sum of all calibration values.

## Functionality

The application includes the following functions:

- `get_digit(word)`: This function takes a word and returns its numerical equivalent if it's a spelled out digit. If the word is not a spelled out digit, it returns the word itself.

- `get_calibration_value(line)`: This function takes a line of text and returns its calibration value. The calibration value is determined by combining the first and last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

- `get_total_calibration_value(filename)`: This function takes a filename, reads the file line by line, calculates the calibration value of each line, and returns the sum of all calibration values.

## Edge Cases

The application is designed to handle a variety of edge cases. For example, it can handle lines that contain no digits, lines that contain only one digit, and lines that contain multiple digits. It can also handle lines that contain spelled out digits in addition to or instead of actual digits.

## Support
